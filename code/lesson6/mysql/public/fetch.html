// makes a request to server to the URL http://localhost:3000/getSomething as a GET request            
fetch("/getSomething")

// we can also add variables to the URL
fetch(`/getSomethingElse/${id}`)

// get does not support sending bodies!!!
// so: whatever kind of information we send: we need to send it as path or as query parameter
// sending it with the path: 
fetch(`/getSomethingElse/${text}`) // does not wiork for a text like "bla/foo" or "bla foo" (space!)
// sending it via query parameter:
fetch(`/getSomethingElse?data=${text}`) // text would be URL encoded and end up like "bla%20foo" 

// fetch has a big number of parameters - see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
// for us right now only 3 are interesting: METHOD, CONTENT-TYPE, BODY
// body used to send data to the server
// method to indicate, which method (CRUD)
// content-type to indicate we are dealing with json data
fetch("/database", {
    method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(dataToSend)
    })
// Using POST, DELETE or PUT is only convention!!!
// Another principle would be to only use post but differentiate what needs to be done via the URL

// We only use json, because it works nicely with javascript 
// like JSON parse creates an object, which we then can access with data.foo
// instead we could use anything else (xml, plain text, yaml, ...)
// Because we can do anything, we need to tell the server, what kind of dat we are sending
// This is the content type
